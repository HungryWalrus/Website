      <p>FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) is an international high school robotics competition, which was founded in 1992 by Dean Kamen and Woodie Flowers. In FRC, each team is given six weeks to design, build, and test a robot to compete in a game designed by FRC. Many of these games include scoring by shooting balls, stacking trash cans, hanging on bars, balancing on beams, and many other tasks. In FRC, students gain insight into a group of engineering industries: manufacturing, mechanical and electrical engingeering, and software design. Additionally FRC provides students with opportunities to apply to a group of scholarships as well as a group of internships with companies like SpaceX or Apple.

      <p>VEX Robotics Competition is one of the world's largest and fastest-growing robotics competitions for middle and high school. Teams of students are tasked with designing and building a robot to play against other teams from around the world in a game-based engineering challenge. During the VEX competition season, teams have several months to design, build, and test a robot to compete in a game designed by VEX.
