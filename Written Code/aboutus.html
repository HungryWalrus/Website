  <h2 class="red_box" style="margin: 1em auto 0">Team 1339</h2>
  <div id="ab_us">
    <p>
      We are from East High School, a diverse inner-city public high school in Denver, Colorado. East's competitive robotics team,
      East Angelbotics, has competed since 2003 in national and international robotics competitions.
      </br>
      </br>
      Our team consists of 40+ members. We are comprised of 8 individual subteams: Business, Drive & Strategy, Electrical, Phuematics, Manufacturing,
      Mechanical & Design, imagery, and Programming. Many of our team members are involved in several subteams.
      Each subteam focuses on different goals that when all brought together, allow us to be successful and unique.
      </br>
      </br>
      <strong>Business</strong> is responsible for the team logistics regarding competition registration, travel, fundraising, and
      paperwork associated with keeping our team compliant.
      </br>
      </br>
      <strong>Drive/Strategy</strong> is responsible for developing a strategy and then driving and operating the robot during competition,
      and providing scouts to analyze other team's strategies at competition.
      </br>
      </br>
      <strong>Electrical</strong> is responsible for the wiring and pneumatics which allow our robot to drive and function.
      </br>
      </br>
      <strong>Pnuematics</strong> is responsible making all air powered actuation function smoothely.
      </br>
      </br>
      <strong>Manufacturing</strong> is responsible for producing all of the parts that make up our robot by using our wood shop
      and other machining tools.
      </br>
      </br>
      <strong>Mechanical/Design</strong> is responsible for the design and construction of our robot including basic strategy and
      CAD.
      </br>
      </br>
      <strong>imagery</strong> is responsible for our team's image, including our yearly theme, t-shirts, pit design and online imagery.
      </br>
      </br>
      <strong>Programming</strong> is responsible for writing code to access electronics and enable our robot to be driven and operated.
    </p>

  <h2 class="red_box" style="margin: 1em auto 0">Team Culture</h2>
  <div id="tculture">
    <p>
      <img> The culture surrounding East Robotics is diverse and unique. As each season progresses, our team slowly becomes a
      tight-knit group of friends, despite their vastly different backgrounds. Teamwork is a major goal of our community
      and we encourage students to learn together and teach each other.
      </br>
      </br>
      Whether it’s naming batteries “Sherlock Ohms” and “John Wattson” or consistently sending the less experienced members to
      find pneumatic fluid, the team members become fast friends. Even though we bond through robotics, our friendships extend
      outside of the club, and continue for the rest of our lifetime.
      </br>
      </br>
      Our theming is a big part of our culture. Every year we challenge ourselves to have a new theme, and try to win the award
      for the best team image. For this challenge, we balance cost with awesome, as the cost new posters and costumes every
      year adds up. Through this challenge, we become closer as a group throughout our season.
